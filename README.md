# check_domain
This is a simple nagios plugin for monitoring domain expiration, that I've maintained and extended.

If you just want to copy the plugin onto your nagios machine, replace PLUGINS_DIR in the command:
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonmce/check_dom
ain/master/check_domain -O PLUGINS_DIR/check_domain
: and make sure it's executable by nagios.

Enjoy!
